# LoRaWAN_SensorNetworks-Catena
This repository is a work-in progress under the Intelligent River v2.0 project at Clemson University,SC. The goal is to interface Catena 4551 OR Catena 4450/4470 with Adafruit Feather M0, developed by MCCI Corporation with different environmental sensors for water,air and soil quality monitoring. This project is based on LoRaWAN (Low Power Wide Area Network) designed to wirelessly connect battery operated ‘things’ to the internet in regional, national or global networks, and targets key Internet of Things (IoT) requirements such as bi-directional communication, end-to-end security, mobility and localization services. Read more about LoRaWAN here: https://lora-alliance.org/about-lorawan. Thus, we have a implemented bunch of IoT nodes on various Clemson Campus streams to monitor channel inflow and strom water wash-off. IoT nodes by definition are controller board coupled with environmental sensors, that act as radio nodes(or modules) connected to central gateway for IoT purposes.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system. You will need the following hardware platform controller boards and softwares, libaries etc. before you dive straight into IoT.
